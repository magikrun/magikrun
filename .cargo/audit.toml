# RUSTSEC-2024-0437: protobuf uncontrolled recursion crash
# 
# JUSTIFICATION: This is a transitive dependency via libcontainer -> rust-criu.
# The vulnerable code path (protobuf parsing) is only used for CRIU checkpoint/restore
# functionality, which is not exposed to untrusted inputs in magikrun's use case.
# 
# UPSTREAM ISSUE: https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/rust-criu/issues/19
# libcontainer pins protobuf = "= 3.2.0" due to rust-criu compatibility.
# 
# RISK: Low. Crash requires attacker-controlled protobuf input to CRIU, which
# is not a supported attack vector in container runtime operations.
# 
# REMEDIATION: Will be resolved when upstream rust-criu updates protobuf dependency.
